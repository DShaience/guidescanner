-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [character, ability, item, quest, location, organization, relationship]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is **English**. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is **English**., just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

If you end up fighting Balthazar, the main things to watch out for are his AOE attacks and the large group of undead allies he summons in the first turn. Make the most out of the higher ground, avoid bunching up, and use any additional party members you have access to like Ranger companions.
Once you've won this battle, you've got another difficult decision to make. Shadowheart wants to kill Nightsong in honor of Shar, but you can also choose to interfere and make Shadowheart stop.
Your choice here will have a big impact on the story.
Without spoiling too much of it, letting Shadowheart kill Nightsong will decimate Last Light Inn and every NPC inside it- but it will also make Thorm vulnerable. Saving Nightsong will give you and the other characters fighting Thorm a huge advantage, but it will deeply harm your relationship with Shadowheart and her path.
For now, we will go with the path where the Nights

 blood sacrifice to begin.
The Self-Same Trial is a mirrored battle where each party member will need to take down a clone version of themselves to progress.
Once you've won, loot the bodies. One of the bodies will have an Umbral Gem that you need.
Save your game, heal up, and press onwards by leaving the Trial room then following the nearby stairs down to the lower level of the Gauntlet.
The next trial is called the Faith-Leap Trial. It's best to take one party member into this trial, although it's possible to do it with more.
The aim here is to follow a hidden path and avoid dark spots, using a map shown in front of the sacrificial altar. It's possible to cheese this trial with a character who can jump very far, a spell scroll that lets you jump further, or a potion that affects jumping or flying.
It is possible for a character to die if they take the wrong step here, so make sure to quickly save before
